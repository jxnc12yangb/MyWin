　　1、Love a person too much,the heart will be drunk;Hate a person too long,the heart will be broken. 爱一个人太深，心会醉；恨一个人太久，心会碎。

　　2、Life is short, live it. Love is rare, grab it.Anger is bad, dump it. Fear is awful, face it.Memories are sweet, cherish it.人生苦短，用心生活。真爱不多，好好把握。生气无益，及早抛弃。恐惧很糟，勇敢面对。甜蜜记忆，好好珍惜。　　3、Love is when you take away the feeling， the passion， the romance， and you find out you still care for that person。 —— 所谓爱，就是当感觉、热情和浪漫统统拿掉之后，你仍然珍惜对方。

　　4、Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you and trusting them not to. 爱就是赋予某人摧毀你的力量却坚信TA不会伤害你。

　　5、The worst kind of pain is when you’re smiling just to stop the tears from falling. 最痛莫过于微笑着让眼泪不要落下来。　　6、Please remember: When the pain of holding on is greater than the pain of letting go, it’s time to let go. 记住：当坚持之苦大过放弃之痛，就是该放手的时候了。

　　7、When you have something you really love but it causes you pain, God is just testing you to see if you are strong enough to hold it. 当你真正喜欢一样东西，但它又给你带来伤害的时候，其实这是老天在考验你是否足够坚持。　　8、Love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.爱，起于微笑，浓于亲吻，逝于泪水。
